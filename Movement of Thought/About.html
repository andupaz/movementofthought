  <h2 id="about" > About me </h2>
  <p> Hello! Welcome to my blog concerning migration issues. My name is Andrea Bregoli,
    I'm an undergraduate student of International Affairs at the Universtiy of St. Gallen, Switzerland,
    with a keen interest in the migration topic and international development. </p>

  <p> The reason for the creation of this blog is my engagement with
    the literature and information I deal with in my free time, mainly consisting in summaries of books and articles,
    and my newly found passion for programming languages. I'm already familiar with LaTeX, which I used
    to write my Bachelor Thesis, R, which I've used to create a Data Visualization portfolio, and now JavaScript
    HTML and CSS, for which I'm doing online courses. </p>

  <p> I hope this little project of mine contributes in whatever
    way possible to those interested in the migration topic. For inputs and discussion topics contact me at
    andreabregoli@outlook.com. </p>

  <h3> Why migration? </h3>

  <p> Migration constitues a great interest of mine mainly because of the fact that my very persona, like of many others, is a product of the
    migration phenomenon. However, I'm not the first generation to be influenced by migration. My mother is Peruvian and my father is Swiss.
    My mother had the possibility to emigrate from Peru and initate a training program in Paris, France, to work at the airport. She and her
    siblings were the first generation to leave Peru. My father belongs to the second generation of a half German and half Italian family. While his
    mother's family partially immigrated from Germany, his father's family emigrated from the Val Trompia region in Northen
    Italy during the beginning of the 20th century as labour migrants. Both met in Zurique while she was visiting her Peruvian friend from
    the good old times. </p>

  <p> I might've been born in Zurique, Switzerland, and therefore having Swiss-German as my first language, but due to employment reasons, my
    family decided to move to SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, where I resided until finishing a German high school. Consequently, speaking Portuguese, German, and
    Spanish formed part of my daily life for 15 years. Since I was (and still am) a music aficionado from an early age, I had learned to speak
    English even before knowing what its words meant, since I would passionately sing along to song lyrics. For this reason, I often think in English
    and chose to purse my studies in an English curriculum in Switzerland, making it my most trained language. Furthermore, since Portugese and
    Spanish are Latin based languages, the learning of French turned out to be quite effective, yet still having only an A2-B1 level in it. </p>

  <p> Migratory acts have determined my life, my personal identity, my way of thinking, my ability to communicate, my social life,
    my education and my interests. Migration has therefore a personal value for me. But this is only one side of the coin. I don't aim to personalise
    or humanise the migration topic with this little biographic account. Many have similar biographies, but not all share the same interest for it.
    My academic interest for this topic was born during a short volunteering experience in Ritsona, Greece, when the EU had struck a deal with
    Turkey concerning the influx of individuals into Europe on the 18th of March 2016. My experience of personally seeing people in this state of
    national limbo made me question the status quo of migration policies and, above all, the reasons for migration acts. In order not assume
    a purely humanitarian stance towards it, I decided to engage with the topic on a more academic level, therefore broadening my perspective of it.
